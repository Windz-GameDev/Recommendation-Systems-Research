These human encyclopedias of cinema see two to five films a day, and from 600 to 2,000 films per year. Many have no physical sex lives, living instead in a world of romance with stars like James Dean or Audrey Hepburn. In Cinemania, Hollywood's biggest fans become the true stars.

The objections of many high-profile technology experts, most notably Richard Stallman, led to what has become known as ""the Open Source Movement,"" which is centered on the belief that computer software should be free both in the economic and intellectual senses of the word. Eventually, one of Stallman's admirers, Linus Torvalds, created a new operating system called Linux, a freely distributed software which many programmers consider to be markedly superior to Windows. Revolution OS is a documentary that examines the genesis of the Open Source Movement, and explores and explains the technical and intellectual issues involved in a manner understandable to computer aficionados and non-techheads alike.‚ÄîMark Deming, Rovi"

Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable, and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill (Dylan Baker), mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), and adolescent son Timmy (Kesun Loder) - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic, since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido (Sir Billy Connolly), as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.‚ÄîHuggo"

Maxed Out takes us on a journey deep inside the American debt-style, where everything seems okay as long as the minimum monthly payment arrives on time. Sure, most of us may have that sinking feeling that something isn't quite right, but we're told not to worry. After all, there's always more credit! Maxed Out shows how the modern financial industry really works, explains the true definition of ""preferred customer"" and tells us why the poor are getting poorer and the rich getting richer. By turns hilarious and profoundly disturbing, Maxed Out paints a picture of a national nightmare which is all too real for most of us.‚ÄîJames Scurlock"

Soon after, this very man is found lying dead as a doornail on the train tracks. Franz Eberhofer, the local policeman in the sleepy Lower Bavarian province of Niederkaltenkirchen, suspects murder. And the prospect is one that does not entirely displease him, as this backwoods offers very little excitement other than the fantastic meals with his cooking-obsessed Grandma or the constant stress with his Beatles-loving Dad. He is supported by Rudi Birkenberger, now a department-store detective but previously with Franz in the Munich detective squad until both were suspended. The H√∂pfl case gets even more tangled when a second corpse is found, that of a drug-addict hustler with whom H√∂pfl had been in contact. Franz must also cope with the fact that his Susi is having an affair and he thinks the lover is the Thai offspring of his estranged brother, who is supposed to be their babysitter.‚ÄîConstantin Television"

Now, he rules the world of Aryth with an iron fist. Enslaved under the Shadow, the race of men leads an oppressed existence, and the elves and dwarves have retreated to distant forests and mountains, where their desperate resistance is slowly succumbing to the unyielding might of the Shadow. Investigating the disappearance of a legate priest, the infamous Mag Kiln has been ordered by the church to travel to the small Erenlander town of Blackweir. There, he soon becomes entangled in an old mystery and begins to uncover not only the forbidden legacy of the town, but the malevolent, prophetic force that grows within him.

This is the story of their rise, their struggle, and ultimately their fate, as their destinies become intertwined with that of the world and the dark god that occupies it.‚ÄîEpic Level Entertainment"

Along the way, Izzard dramatizes or comments on the search for a career, bad giraffes, Prince Philip's gaffes, toilets in French campsites, the mysteries of hopscotch, becoming one's Dad, getting a computer to print, and his court victory after being the victim of tranny bashing. Izzard calls his bits ""mimes,"" in part because his physical comedy is sans props. Filmed at Labatt's Apollo Theatre, Izzard is in a shimmering red pants suit and low heels.‚Äî<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

Carlin once again comes up with an hour of brand new material that not only makes you laugh, but makes you think. George Carlin will always remain part of the popular lexicon for his 'Seven Dirty Words' routine, and as a comedian who was never afraid to challenge his audience.‚ÄîAnonymous"

The reasons are several: It was his first HBO show done live; it was the first he had done in his hometown, New York City; and it was the largest audience he had ever worked before: 6,500.But Carlin says it also represented a newfound sophistication in his writing. ""It was the first time I had done truly extended pieces consisting of separate sections all flowing together. It was a big leap for me.""The show, taped at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden and winner of the 1992 CableACE Award, is a perfect blend of biting social commentary and more gently-observed observational pieces.‚ÄîAnonymous"

They find that some type of disaster has de-populated the Idaho region and, by implication, the nation--or perhaps the world. Facing an unknown, barren future of abandoned towns and deserted vehicles, void of radio signals or any signs of air or land traffic, they encounter an abandoned freight train filled with bagged bodies. Their further discoveries of humanity's future fate is less than rosy. They also learn that their time travel was not without significant costs to their own health. After one of the group travels further into the future, she encounters a family in a futuristic automobile, which implies that humankind has recovered from the disaster. Or have they?‚Äîozman"

Not only his lifetime girlfriend has just to finished with him to be a guy with no ambition, but he becomes the target of a series of thugs led by V√°zquez, a dangerous criminal who has just escaped from jail. Also he discovers that his father has a double identity. He is not a farmer engaged in the production of cold meat - as Adolfo has believed all his life, but Anacleto, a secret agent who is a bit down and the man who locked V√°zquez up in jail thirty years ago. Adolfo will have to leave his comfort zone and work with his father, the person that Adolfo get on worse with in the world to survive the revenge of Vazquez and while, between shootouts and chases, trying to get his girlfriend back.‚ÄîAngelo Olivier"

Today aged 104, Pomsel served as Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels' stenographer. Brunhilde Pomsel's life mirrors all the major breaks and continuities of the 20th century. Many people think that the dangers of war and fascism have been overcome. Brunhilde Pomsel makes it clear that this is not case. ""A German Life"" makes the viewer automatically ask: How would I have acted? What principles might I have betrayed to advance my career? Her extraordinary biography and personal journey into the past lead to the disturbing but timeless question: How reliable is my own moral compass?"

183317,"It's Christmas time in the twin cities. Billy's working a lot of overtime, running barges on the Mississippi. He calls his friend Eddie, whom he hasn't seen in six months, and asks a favor: to drive with him to see his pregnant girlfriend, Patti, because Billy hasn't told her he's married and already has two children. The road trip of guy talk becomes a night of truths exchanged between men and women.‚Äî<jhailey@hotmail.com>"
