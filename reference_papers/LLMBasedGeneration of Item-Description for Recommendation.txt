ABSTRACT
The description of an item plays a pivotal role in providing con-
cise and informative summaries to captivate potential viewers and
is essential for recommendation systems. Traditionally, such de-
scriptions were obtained through manual web scraping techniques,
which are time-consuming and susceptible to data inconsistencies.
In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5,
and open source LLMs like Alpaca have emerged as powerful tools
for natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we have ex-
plored how we can use LLMs to generate detailed descriptions of
the items. To conduct the study, we have used the MovieLens 1M
dataset comprising movie titles and the Goodreads Dataset con-
sisting of names of books and subsequently, an open-sourced LLM,
Alpaca, was prompted with few-shot prompting on this dataset to
generate detailed movie descriptions considering multiple features
like the names of the cast and directors for the ML dataset and
the names of the author and publisher for the Goodreads dataset.
The generated description was then compared with the scraped
descriptions using a combination of Top Hits, MRR, and NDCG as
evaluation metrics. The results demonstrated that LLM-based movie
description generation exhibits significant promise, with results
comparable to the ones obtained by web-scraped descriptions.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3604915.3610647movie recommendation systems have become even more relevant.
It has already been proven in previous research [ 8], [10], [9], [2]
and [ 1] that the textual description of items plays an important role
in the recommendation domain.
In most of the previous papers, the authors have web-crawled
websites like IMDB or Goodreads to get the textual description of
the movies or books. The manual writing of item descriptions may
suffer from the writer’s personal biases, human errors, and costly
human resources. So, in this paper, we are proposing a method
that uses Large Language Models(LLMs) to generate the descrip-
tion of the items on demand. Additionally, web scraping methods
are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to data inconsis-
tencies. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in the field of natural language processing, there is a promising
alternative to automate the generation of movie descriptions. LLMs
have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by
exhibiting remarkable language understanding and generation ca-
pabilities. Leveraging the power of LLMs, researchers have explored
their applications in various domains, including text generation,
translation, summarization, and dialogue systems. However, their
potential in generating item descriptions as an alternative to web
scraping remains relatively unexplored.
To conduct the study, a comprehensive dataset of movie titles,
the MovieLens 1m [ 5] and a dataset of names of books, Goodreads
[16][15] was used and their corresponding descriptions were col-
lected using web scraping techniques. This served as our baseline.
Then we leveraged the capabilities of LLMs to generate the de-
scriptions using the movie titles to compare LLM with IMDB on
recommendation task.
The implications of this research extend to the online recommen-
dation industry as automated item description generation using
LLMs can streamline the process of creating accurate and engaging
summaries. By reducing reliance on web scraping and manual cu-
ration, content providers can save valuable time and effort and can
remove personal biases in the website from where the description
is being scraped. Additionally, this study contributes to the broader
field of natural language processing by showcasing the capabili-
ties of LLMs in generating high-quality textual content for various
applications.
This work aims to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency
of LLMs in generating movie descriptions compared to manually
curated web scraping methods. By comparing LLM-generated de-
scriptions with those obtained through web scraping, we seek to
evaluate the quality, accuracy, and coherency of the LLM-generated
descriptions and assess their potential for automating this crucial
aspect of recommendation systems.

2 METHODOLOGY
In the next two subsections, we discuss the problem statements and
our proposed solutions.
2.1 Problem Statement
A modelMthat outputs recommendation list by considering behav-
ior data including rating 𝑅, user_id𝑈_𝐼𝑑, item_id𝐼_𝐼𝑑and manually
created description D1with performance as A1. If a function 𝑓cre-
ats descriptionD2leveraging LLM such that D2=𝑓(𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚 _𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒)
and after replacing D1byD2gives the recommendation perfor-
mance asA2then|(A1−A 2|≤𝜖, where𝜖is the positive number
defining tolerance in the performance.
2.2 Proposed Solution
This paper uses the knowledge and instruction following capabili-
ties of Large Language Models to generate missing textual descrip-
tions of movies which can be used as a feature for the Recommenda-
tion System. In this work, we have followed the method proposed in
the GRU4RECBE [ 10] paper and the movie descriptions generated
by Alpaca-Lora to establish our claim. Our method can be broadly
divided into two steps, discussed below.
•Generating the Description of the items using LLM
:This paper uses Alpaca-Lora LLM in order to generate
the textual description of the items. Alpaca-Lora has been
instruction tuned on the open sourced LLaMa [ 14] LLM to
generate results similar to the Alpaca Model [ 13] using the
the Low Rank Adaptation Technique [ 7]. We have further
prompted the LLM suing the Few-shot prompting to generate
the most accurate results in the desired format. The name
of the movie or books is concatenated with a well designed
prompt and fed into the LLM to generate the item description.
This description can now be used for the recommendation
system. A sample prompt and the results produced by the
LLM has been shown in Figure 1b.
•Using the Movie Ids and the textual description of
the movies to train the recommendation system.: We
follow model architecture that has been mentioned in the
GRU4RECBE [ 10] paper to train the model. This method
proposes to find and generate the Item ID embedding and
the BERT [ 4] embedding utilizing the item description. The
movie description and movie id embedding are summed and
passed through a GRU layer for predicting the next items. A
detailed flowchart of the training process has been shown
in Figure 1a.
3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
•We have used the MovieLens 1m [ 5] dataset which is a pop-
ular benchmark for evaluating recommendation systems.
We have also used the publicly available ImdbId identifier
and Cinemagoer(here) to obtain the IMDB text descriptions
along in addition to the user id, movie id, and timestamp for
each user click which is already contained in the MovieLens
dataset.
We have also used the Goodreads Book graph Dataset [ 16][15]
to test our proposal. We have used a subset of this dataset
with over 50,000 interactions consisting of 1500 books, each

(b) The prompt used and the output generated by the LLM

of which had more than 20 reviews, and 1651 users where
each user had provided more than 20 reviews.
•We have used the leave-one-out evaluation for the next item
recommendation task. We consider each user as a session,
and for each user, we take the last item of the session as the
test set and the second last as the validation set; all other
items form a part of the training set. The maximum session
length is set to 200 movies and we pair each ground-truth
movie in the test set with 00 random negative movies which
the user has not interacted with [ 12]. The negative movies
are sampled in order of their popularity without replacement.
Thus, we rank the ground-truth movie amongst the 100 ran-
domly selected item for each user.(GRU4RECBE). We have
used the BPR MAX [ 6] loss function and the alternate opti-
mization approach where we alternate between optimizing
the weights of the plot embedding and movie id embedding
layer at each epoch.(GRU4RECBE). The hyperparameter used
for our experiment is listed below in Table 1.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 2 summarizes the best evaluation value for different propor-
tions of the description generated by LLM along with the max-
imum value achieved using only the IMDB movie plots and the
GRU4RECBE model architecture. It is seen that the performance
achieved by LLM is very close to the performance archived by
using the IMDB plots across all metrics such has Hit Rate, Nor-
malized Discount Cumulative Gain(NDCG), and Mean Reciprocal
Rank(MRR) (Primary metric used). A similar result can be seen
in Table 3. for the Goddreads dataset. The similarity between the
descriptions obtained from LLM and from web-scraping = Cosine-
Similarity (STE(IMDB desc.), STE(LLM desc.)) = 0.4398. STE: Sen-
tence Transformer Embedding. Model used: ’all-MiniLM-L6-v2’

5 CONCLUSION
We can thus conclude that the text description generated from LLMs
can be used in the place of traditionally obtained descriptions using
web-scraping techniques to obtain competitive results. The LLM,
that we have used in this paper (Alpaca-LoRa) is highly susceptible
to hallucination while generating descriptions of the items and
might be factually incorrect while generating the names of the cast,
directors, author and publisher, specially of older items with limited
popularity. This problem can be dealt with when using a better-
tuned and larger LLM on more recent movies, and we believe that it
can result in better results. This also highlights the potential of LLMs
in automating items description generation which is comparable to
traditional web scraping methods and can reduce the reliance on
web scraping and thus saving time and effort for content providers
and removing any personal biases in the website from where the
description is being scraped.
